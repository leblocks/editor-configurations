# Editor configuration files

## Why?
I use this repo to sync configuration files across multiple environments. By providing soft links to cloned repository.

## Config files
* *.vimrc* - vanilla vim configuration, no plugins, only builtin feature usage.
* *.ideavimrc* - configuration file for *[IdeaVim plugin](https://github.com/JetBrains/ideavim)*
* *.vscode.json* - vscode json configuration with remaps for *[VSCodeVim plugin](https://github.com/VSCodeVim/Vim)*
